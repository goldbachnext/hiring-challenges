#Task 2: Optimize on async functions

##Description
Rewrite the - ```getAllImpressions``` method to get better performance and explain the mechanics behind the solution.
Approach the task as you would approach real life project, code base changes and refactors are allowed. But do not change the ```timeout``` variable ;)  


##start
```node index.js```
